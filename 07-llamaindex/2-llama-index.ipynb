He\\nis also a citizen of the United States, where he attended\\nall of his schooling and lived for 48 years prior to\\nreturning to England.\\nGraham and his family moved to Pittsburgh,\\nPennsylvania, in 1968, where he attended Gateway\\nHigh School. Graham gained interest in science and\\nmathematics from his father who was a nuclear\\nphysicist.[8]\\nGraham received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in\\nphilosophy from Cornell University in 1986.[9][10][11]\\nHe then received a Master of Science in 1988, and a\\nDoctor of Philosophy in 1990, both in computer\\nscience from Harvard University.[9][12]\\nGraham has also studied painting at the Rhode Island\\nSchool of Design and at the Accademia di Belle Arti in\\nFlorence.[9][12]\\nEducation and early life\\nCareer', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

They\\nbelieved that Viaweb was the first application service provider.[13] Graham received a patent for webapps\\nbased on his work at Viaweb.[14] Viaweb\\'s software, written mostly in Common Lisp, allowed users to\\nmake their own Internet stores. In the summer of 1998, after Jerry Yang received a strong\\nrecommendation from Ali Partovi,[15] Viaweb was sold to Yahoo! for 455,000 shares of Yahoo! stock,\\nvalued at $49.6 million.[16] After the acquisition, the product became Yahoo! Store.\\nGraham later gained notice for his essays, which he posts on his personal website. Essay subjects range\\nfrom Beating the Averages,[17] which compares Lisp to other programming languages and introduced the\\nhypothetical programming language Blub, to Why Nerds are Unpopular,[18] a discussion of nerd life in\\nhigh school. A collection of his essays has been published as Hackers & Painters[6] by O\\'Reilly Media,\\nwhich includes a discussion of the growth of Viaweb and the advantages of Lisp to program it.\\nIn 2001, Graham announced that he was working on a new dialect of Lisp named Arc. It was released on\\n29 January 2008.[19] Over the years since, he has written several essays describing features or goals of the\\nlanguage, and some internal projects at Y Combinator have been written in Arc, including the Hacker\\nNews web forum and news aggregator program.\\nIn 2005, after giving a talk at the Harvard Computer Society later published as How to Start a Startup,\\nGraham along with Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris started Y Combinator to\\nprovide seed funding to startups, particularly those started by younger, more technically oriented\\nfounders. Y Combinator has invested in more than 1300 startups, including Reddit, Twitch (formerly\\nJustin.tv), Xobni, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Stripe.[20]\\nBusinessWeek included Paul Graham in the 2008 edition of its annual feature, The 25 Most Influential\\nPeople on the Web.[21]\\nIn response to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), Graham announced in late 2011 that no\\nrepresentatives of any company supporting it would be invited to Y Combinator\\'s Demo Day events.[22]\\nIn February 2014, Graham stepped down from his day-to-day role at Y Combinator.[23]\\nIn October 2019, Graham announced a specification for another new dialect of Lisp, written in itself,\\nnamed Bel.[24]\\nGraham proposed a disagreement hierarchy in a 2008 essay How to Disagree,[25] putting types of\\nargument into a seven-point hierarchy and observing that \"If moving up the disagreement hierarchy\\nmakes people less mean, that will make most of them happier.\" Graham also suggested that the hierarchy\\ncan be thought of as a pyramid, as the highest forms of disagreement are rarer.\\nFollowing this hierarchy, Graham notes that articulate forms of name-calling (e.g., \"The author is a self-\\nimportant dilettante\") are no different from crude insults. When in disagreement people often become\\nmore animated and engaged, and this leads to them becoming angry.[26] At the lower levels, the attacks\\nGraham\\'s hierarchy of disagreement', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

It is not\\nthe most powerful language, but it is\\nmore powerful than Cobol or machine\\nlanguage.\"[29] It was used by Graham to illustrate a comparison, beyond Turing completeness, of\\nprogramming language power, and more specifically to illustrate the difficulty of comparing a\\nprogramming language one knows to one that one does not.\\n...These studies would like to formally prove that a certain language is more or less expressive\\nthan another language. Determining such a relation between languages objectively rather than\\nsubjectively seems to be somewhat problematic, a phenomenon that Paul Graham has discussed\\nin \"The Blub Paradox\".[30][31]\\nGraham considers a hypothetical Blub programmer. When the programmer looks down the \"power\\ncontinuum\", they consider the lower languages to be less powerful because they miss some feature that a\\nBlub programmer is used to. But when they look up, they fail to realize that they are looking up: they\\nmerely see \"weird languages\" with unnecessary features and assumes they are equivalent in power, but\\nwith \"other hairy stuff thrown in as well\". When Graham considers the point of view of a programmer\\nusing a language higher than Blub, he describes that programmer as looking down on Blub and noting its\\n\"missing\" features from the point of view of the higher language.[30]\\nGraham describes this as the Blub paradox and concludes that \"By induction, the only programmers in a\\nposition to see all the differences in power between the various languages are those who understand the\\nmost powerful one.\"[30]\\nThe concept has been cited by programmers such as Joel Spolsky.[32]\\nThe Blub paradox\\nPersonal life', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",
