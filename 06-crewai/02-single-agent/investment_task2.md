### 2. Specific Investment Suggestions
- **Fixed Deposits:**  
  Consider investing in a reputable bank offering competitive interest rates (around 6-7%). This provides stability and assured returns.
  
- **Mutual Funds:**  
  Opt for a mix of equity and debt mutual funds. Consider SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) in large-cap funds for growth potential along with balanced or debt funds for stability (recommended funds: HDFC Equity Fund, SBI Bluechip Fund).

- **Public Provident Fund (PPF):**  
  Open a PPF account, which has a maturity period of 15 years and currently offers an interest rate of 7.1%, allowing tax-free returns. Invest up to ₹1,50,000 per year (₹12,500 monthly).

- **National Pension System (NPS):**  
  Invest in NPS for long-term retirement savings. It provides tax benefits under Section 80C (₹1,50,000 limit) and an additional ₹50,000 under Section 80CCD(1B).

- **NPS Contributions:** ₹14,000 monthly will support your long-term savings and provide an additional deduction of ₹50,000 under Section 80CCD(1B).

- **Total Tax Deductions:** If you utilize the full limits of both PPF and NPS, you could potentially reduce your taxable income by ₹2,00,000 in the financial year, leading to considerable tax savings depending on your tax slab.
